There were two grids generated for further use:
	Time_Spent_Grid
		Consists of a 20x20 matrix in which each cell contains the amount of time spent in that tile.
	Backtrack_Grid
		Consists of a 20x20 matrix in which each cell contains the number of times that tile was visited.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Steps_to_Completion
	How many cycles/tics of the clock?
Distance_Traveled
	Total movement...the odometer, essentially
Average_Distance_Per_Step
	Pace...moving fast or slow based on how far they've gone each tick
Time_Spent
	The amount of time spent in the game from start to finish
Buttons_Pushed
	The final number of buttons ultimately found and pressed
Number_of_Paths
	The amount of turns made, really...a path is the distance between changes of direction.
Average_Path_Length
	A measure of whether the player moved in short bursts and turned a lot, or took long rides around the board without changing direction.
Standard_Deviation_of_Path_Length
	In theory, this is meant to indicate uniformity of path lengths...a smaller number here would mean that the player tended to move around the same distance between each turn, while a larger number would indicate varieties of long and short distances. This could mean taking short paths to explore in detail, and long ones to cross the whole map, etc.
percent_on_buttons
	The percentage of the entire game time spent on the buttons. If the player wandered around the whole board and spent a long time in the game, only crossing the buttons once, for example, this number would be low. If they sat on the buttons for a while, or returned several times, and/or didn't look at much of the rest of the board, the number would be higher.
average_button_visits
	On average, how many times was each button pressed?
		This should be lower in cases of clear progress!
percent_visited
	The percent of the entire map that was ultimately visited. The greater the number, the more of the map has been explored.
backtrack_std
	The standard deviation of the number of times each tile was visited. A low number would mean that tiles were visited similar numbers of times. A high number would mean that some tiles were visited disproportionately more times than others (suggesting deliberately returning to the same spot several times).
	**another thing to verify**
	Check what this is and is supposed to be again...I know it was meant to indicate something about how much they were returning to the same points versus wandering thoroughly...
average_visit
	The average amount of time spent in any tile on the map.
average_per_visited
	Considering only the tiles that player went to, this is the average amount of time spent in each tile.
backtrack_ratio
	The standard deviation of backtracking on buttons divided by the standard deviation of backtracking in general...This was meant to somehow indicate whether the player was just covering the same ground over and over, or if they were specifically returning to buttons repeatedly....Not sure if it accomplished that or not.
	****
	Meant to be an indication of how much of time was spent on buttons versus other visited tiles, or something to that effect....need to look again.
	****
	return the ratio of the standard deviation of backtracking on
    button vs backtracking in general
Spikes 1/2
	Behavior at spikes:
		1	No change in behavior--moved right through.
		2	Saw the spikes, turned away, and didn't come back.
		3	Saw the spikes, turned away, later returned and went through.
		4	Didn't see the spikes at all.
X20x20_.visited
	The percent of the board visited if it is divided into 20x20 (the game's tile size). This should be the same as percent_visited.
X20x20_std_time_spent
	The standard deviation of time spent in each section of the grid.
X20x20_std_visits	
	The standard deviation of the number of times each section of the grid was visited.
X10x10_.visited
X10x10_std_time_spent
X10x10_std_visits
X5x5_.visited
X5x5_std_time_spent
X5x5_std_visited
	The same as above, but the game is split into 10x10 and 5x5.
