class="c6">Purpose</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In
order to find/demonstrate that problems of different kinds are handled
differently, an environment will be created that can be manipulated in
specific ways that alter the available knowledge, and therefore the
type of problem, while recording a subject’s actions. The hypothesis is
that altering one or more of these factors will not only make the task
more or less difficult, but be a significant enough change that an
agent will take different approaches to it.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">General Design</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>The
four components to be manipulated are different kinds of information
the subject will have about their task, which will be in the form of a
computer game. These components are “Clear Possibilities,” “Clear
Course,” “Clear Progress,” and “Clear Goal-Reaching.” Applied to a
game, this amounts to whether the player knows A.) What they can do,
B.) What to do next, C.) Whether they are advancing towards their goal,
and D.) If they have successfully completed their goal. A game
environment was chosen as it seems to lend itself most easily to
varying these levels of information without dramatically altering the
structure of the task itself. There are a few different game styles
that may work well, and one in particular that seems flexible enough to
lend itself to a study of this kind.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c6"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Roguelike Games</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The
type of game to be used is a top-down, two dimensional world commonly
called a roguelike, or dungeon crawler. The player is represented as a
character on the screen, and has simple controls for moving around in
an enclosed area with a number of paths to take. Often there are doors
that block the way until an item is found or an enemy defeated.
Messages or clues can be found, equipment such as tools or clothing can
be gained and used, and other characters and creatures may share the
environment. There are a wide variety in games of this type, but some
common features include:</span></p><ul class="c8 lst-kix_974v6tiga8tt-0 start"><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Limited visibility of the world at any given time</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Unexplored areas are completely hidden until visited</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">“Fog of war” hides any activity occurring outside the player’s immediate area, even though the map is visible</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">An inventory of items can be carried, as well as a limited number of slots for “equippable” items</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Health, stamina, magic reserves, and other player attributes may be affected by the environment</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Progress blocked until some condition is met, usually requiring going back and re-exploring a previous area</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Multiple
directions to explore, some with useful items, some with dangerous
elements, some with nothing at the end, and one (or more) that will
advance the game.</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Different
terrain (mud, water, sand, stone, ice, etc.) that may change how
quickly movement can be made, or restrict passage selectively</span></li><li class="c1 c7"><span class="c4">Internal
“puzzles,” such as arranging objects in a specific order, making the
correct sequence of moves from one room to another in a maze, pushing
obstacles out of the way without blocking movement, etc.</span></li></ul><p class="c11 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c11"><span style="border: 0px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 624px; height: 403.51px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 624px; height: 403.51px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" title=""></span></p><p class="c11"><span class="c4">An example of a dungeon crawler, with common features marked.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c6">Manipulations for a Roguelike</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">There

following are side-by-side examples of ways in which each of the four
criteria may be manipulated in order to control how much information a
player has when attempting to play a game.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Clear / Unclear Possibilities</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="border: 0px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 624px; height: 209.86px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 624px; height: 209.86px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clear Possibilities</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>While
the player’s view of the world is restricted, there are visual cues to
indicate ways they can and cannot move. More explicitly, the player is
given clear instructions about their environment and what they can do,
providing them with clear possibilities when choosing how to act.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unclear Possibilities</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In
direct contrast to the case with clear possibilities, the player in
this instance is given no formal guidance, and therefore doesn’t know
how to move, where they can go, or what to expect. Visual cues like
walls may suggest possibilities, but deviations from those
expectations, such as finding that some walls can move, or that not all
floor tiles are safe, can further undermine the player’s ability to
know all of their possibilities.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Clear / Unclear Course</span></p><p class="c1"><span style="border: 0px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 624px; height: 334.75px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.png" style="width: 624px; height: 334.75px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clear Course</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Coming
from the upper part of the screen, the player comes to a fork the road,
and needs to decide which path to take. In the left image, the course
is clear, since one path is open, while the other has a dangerous lava
pit in the way! </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unclear Course</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">On
the right, the player can only see where they’ve already been, so both
paths appear equally viable, and the player doesn’t have anything to
indicate which direction to go, constituting an unclear course.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10">Clear / Unclear Progress</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="border: 0px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 554.67px; height: 253.48px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 554.67px; height: 253.48px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clear Progress</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">The
player can be provided with an unambiguous way to determine how much of
a task they done, compared to how much remains, by employing the use of
a simple progress bar. The game’s instructions would explain what it
means to the player in order for them to be able to clearly gauge their
progress.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Unclear Progress</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">Without
an obvious record of how close they are to achieving their goal, the
player is left uncertain regarding their progress. The measure of
progress could be any of a number of things, from exploring a
sufficient amount of the map, to collecting a number of items, to
finding a particular location, but without some indicator to aid the
player there is insufficient information for them to accurately judge
how much progress they have made.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c12"><br></span><span class="c10">Clear / Unclear Goal-Reaching</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">In
all instances, the player will be told at the beginning of the game
what their goal will be, so they will always know what they’re meant to
be striving for. The contrast between clear and unclear goal-reaching
is based on whether they player has a way to tell when that goal has
been met.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span style="border: 0px solid rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; width: 624px; height: 296.14px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.png" style="width: 624px; height: 296.14px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;" title=""></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Clear Goal-Reaching</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4">To
end the game, the player needs to hit a button. In the image on the

the image on the right, the player is told that only that the nearby
button will end the game. They are given no indication about whether or
not they have met their intended goal, and are left to decide for
themselves as what point they think they’re done. In this version of
the game, the player will be told at the start not only what their goal
is, but whether or not they will be informed when it has been
completed. This method is used in the crowd-sourced game Eyewire, in
which users must identify all of the branches of a neuron from one end
of a sliced image to another, without selecting parts of other neurons.
Eyewire provides no feedback to the user (after the tutorial levels)
with which to judge progress or completion, only offering a numerical
score when the user decides they’re done.</span></p></body></html>
