        <p><u>About This Study</u></p>
        <p>Project Title: A Study of Types of Problem Solving using a Simple Video Game
            <br> Researchers: Daniel Holman, Jeff Yoshimi
            <br> Organization: Cognitive and Information Sciences, University of California, Merced</p>
        <p>Please take as much time as needed to read and understand the following information:</p>
        <p>In this study, you will use a computer to view a series of visual stimuli, complete simple tasks, and make judgments. The experiment should take approximately the time advertised in the HIT bringing you to this page. The experiment will not expose you to more than the normal risk associated with using a computer.</p>
        <p>The compensation for this experiment is <u>70&cent;</u> and paid through Mechanical Turk.</p>
        <p>In exchange for your time, you will receive a code to input on Mechanical Turk for payment on the final screen. There is no cost to you beyond your time and effort. In addition to the financial gain, you will be contributing to society through information we are gathering about human cognition.</p>
        <p>Your identity in the study will be treated as confidential; in addition, no information that could be used to identify you will be collected. The results of the study may be published for scientific purposes, but will not give your name or include any identifiable references to you. The raw data may be made available to other researchers and interested parties in the future. To reiterate, no identifying information will be collected and therefore any sharing of the data will not be able to be traced back to you, the individual. However, absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed, since research documents are not protected from subpoena.</p>
        <p>In order to participate in this study you need to read English well enough to understand this consent document and to understand the instructions. Additionally, the Amazon Mechanical Turk system should have only shown this study to you if you have a 95% approval rating and are located in the United States of America.</p>
        <p>Please remember you are free to choose whether or not to participate in this study. You may choose to withdraw from the experiment at any time without penalty by navigating away from the experiment in your browser.</p>
        <p>Any questions you have concerning the study itself can be answered by the contact researcher, Daniel Holman (dholman@ucmerced.edu). Any questions you have about your rights as a research subject may be addressed to the Office of Research at (209) 383-8655 or by mail at the Office of Research, 5200 N Lake Road, Merced, CA, 95343. The Office of Research will inform the Institutional Review Board, a panel who reviews the research to protect your rights. If you have complaints or concerns about this study, you may direct them to Ramesh Balasubramaniam, Chair of the Institutional Review Board (IRBchair@ucmerced.edu, (209) 383-8655). Daniel Holman is also your contact should you have issues with payment on Mechanical Turk.</p>
