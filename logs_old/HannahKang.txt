It was not very engaging or fun to play, but there was nothing that was particularly bad about it.
The game ran smoothly. 
The game screen shake when the robot ran into the wall, but it seems like a cool effect to keep. I'm not sure if I counted 8 red buttons, but it may have been me miscounting them. I initially thought that the robot couldn't pass the spikes, but it turned out that wasn't the case and it was interesting. 
Not particularly. It would have been nice if it displayed how many buttons the robot found already, but it may interfere with the experiment, as I do not know what the game is supposed to measure. 
I liked the sound when a gate opened.
