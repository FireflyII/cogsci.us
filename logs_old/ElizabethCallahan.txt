The game was a generic computer game that reminded me of one you would find on an old windows format.
The game ran smooth for the most part. The only times it lagged was when the vehicle hit a wall or tried to jump from one section to another.
The only glitches were the ones mentioned in the question above.
I was confused on when the game was going to end, and how many red knobs I was supposed to hit.
