I thought the blue button would be harder to get to, and it threw me off that it was behind the start position. 
It lagged just a tad, but was generally quite smooth.
I did not notice anything. 
I read the instructions twice, and thought I needed to press all the red buttons to get to the blue one, but that didn't end up being the case. So that was most likely my bad.
