I was wondering about what was the goal for opening all the doors. Nothing in particular stood.
It ran smoothly, but at the beginning, when I was holding 'w'to speed up, it wouldn't speed up right away.
No other glitches or bugs that I noticed.
Just what my goal was and how to end the game. I stumbled on the end button by surprise.
The graphics were cute.
