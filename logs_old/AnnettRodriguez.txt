I was trying to figure out what the objective was. It reminded me of the super old school derby pacman game. The only thing that really stood out was as the car crossed over the circles walls would open. The trees are cool, I thought touching them would of provoked something.
The game ran really smoothly actually even while pressing the "shift" key
Yes, I noticed not every "circle" or "spot" had an activation i.e. opening the wall door. Also the "control" console that teleported you when you landed on it, I noticed that it only worked on the bottom lower end and not the top right where the other "non-working" one is to be found. For this part I expected to be able to teleport, just as the functioning one, between these two not just one.
I didn't know what we were supposed to do, I just started experimenting moving the car to all the "spots"on the screen and I also touched on all the trees and edges/corners of the wall because based on previous "Mario" games we are able to walk through the walls to discover a secret door, or gem or something. The only thing I found confusing was that the objective wasn't too clear or perhaps the game was just too easy haha
I can't wait to see whats next!
