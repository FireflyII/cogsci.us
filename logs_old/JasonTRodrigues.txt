Reminds me of an old atari game, with the same sort of classic, choppy feel. 
Ran smoothly
No glitches
No apparent end state when all buttons are pressed. "Spike trap" looking ground texture is not really a spike trap. 
After failing to find a way around "spike trap" texture for a good amount of time, I attempted to cross it expecting a fail state but there was none.
