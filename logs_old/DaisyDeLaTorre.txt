The first time the robot went over a red button it opened a wall, however after going over another red button the wall did not open. 
The game ran smoothly as far as controlling the robot and navigating through the course.
As mentioned before, the walls did not open after going over the buttons. The first time the robot went over the red button it did function properly. 
No, the directions were clear and just involved navigating through the course.
I would hear the click sound when going over the buttons, but the walls did not move out of the way.
