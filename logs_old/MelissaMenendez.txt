I don't play much video games, but it seems like the graphics are for a typical video game. 
For me, the game ran very smooth. 
I did not notice any glitches. The game worked fine for me. 
It was straight forward. 
Maybe work on better graphics because they look a bit blurry, but it is also fine this way.
