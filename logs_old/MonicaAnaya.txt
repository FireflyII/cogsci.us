There were a couple of areas that looked like spikes and I thought they were gonna "kill" me if I "drove" over because the area that it led to was also gray while the area I was coming from was yellow
It seemed to run smoothly. I did not notice any lag.
I didn't notice any bugs; However,  I don't know if it was my reaction time or just the way it was set up, or maybe even just my keyboard but sometimes I would hold a button (e.g. down) and want to turn and while still holding the first button and I would press another (e.g. left) and I didn't pay enough attention but sometimes it would turn to whatever the second button was (left) and other times just continue to go in the direction of the first button (down).
I thought when I pressed all the buttons it would tell me that I was finished, but I never got a notification.
I thought the one-way portal would differentiate between the start and the end destination... maybe different color or so.
Also, I thought the trees would be hiding a button but they hid nothing.
