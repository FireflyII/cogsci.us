I thought it was interesting because the maze was very tricky. The blue spots stood out because their size.
It lagged in the sense where I was not able to see the amount of red spots the robot hit on the top of the page as stated.
I couldn't see the numbers above that indicated the amount of red dots.
Yes when I hit the blue button I wasn't sure if I had accidentally pressed something wrong. I wasn't sure if I had completed what I needed to.
It was a fun game I felt as if I was inside the maze!
