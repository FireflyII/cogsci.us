I really liked this game it made you backtrack where you have been and what areas may now be accesible that previously were not.
It ran smoothly; however, I myself have never really been a gamer so my standards may not be as hi as someone who is and or was once.
Some buttons I thing did not open anything and or I just couldnt find what they did.
I  found the wasd controls weird so I just used the arrows and shift, also the layout itself was confusing but in a good way.
I pretty much enjoyed the game, was low key expecting to make it to some kind of end or prize or ultimate goal maybe there is one and I just am inexpericed in the video game realm and could not get to it.
