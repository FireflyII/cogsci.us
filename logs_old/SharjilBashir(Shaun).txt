I thought it was interesting.
The white tiles that looked like spikes on the ground didn't hurt you or end the game, and if you stood on the buttons they wouldn't make the unlock noise until you stepped off of it. Like most games there are secrets and hidden items, I found a button(s) behind a tree that was, I guess, supposed to be hidden. The "portal" tile or wall in the game is only one way, so you can't use it to go back. I don't know if the game has an alternate ending, but I feel it might since there were buttons and maze puzzles that seem to be concealing more secrets. 
The game ran smoothly. the screen would shake violently if you ran into a wall, ended the game, or used the "portal"
Well, I'm not sure how the game is supposed to work, so I can't tell if it would be a bug or not. The buttons would sometimes activate even though you didn't directly go over them. You could walk by them and they would activate. The 'portal' is only one way, and from past games and experiences, I expected it to be a two-way portal. The tiles with the spike-like items gave me the expectations that those would harm me or end the game when they did nothing at all. The shift button didn't make me go fast on certain tiles, and on other tiles, we would move very slowly or very fast in one direction.
The instructions were straightforward. The game's environment was rather open-ended, somewhat like a sandbox, where I can go around doing anything. I'm not sure if I missed any other directions or key information to guide me in the game. 
Please fix the move faster key. It was not functioning in certain areas of the game. Also, some ambient music would be nice. thankyou, that is all.
