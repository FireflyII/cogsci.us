I think this game was okay given the information that was given. I would've liked to know what the symbols mean like the ones that relocate you and the bowling pins that let you pass. Also I didn't think we would be able to go around the tree. 
The game was very smooth for me. The only time I got stuck was when I ran into a wall. 
There were no glitches for me. I didn't expect to be relocated. Also, didn't expect to be able to go on the grass around the trees. 
Yes, I thought the symbols should have been explained before we started playing. 
I think there should be counter that displays the number of red buttons I found. Also, the buttons that have been found should be a different color to keep track of the previously found buttons.
