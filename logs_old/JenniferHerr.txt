My general thoughts were that what am I suppose to do or achieve in finishing the game. There seems to be no objective or purpose in the game at all. Well, the car stood out the most.
The game ran smoothly with no problems.
Some of the red buttons opened doors yet others didn't.
I did not know what to do - I was confused the whole entire time playing the game.
