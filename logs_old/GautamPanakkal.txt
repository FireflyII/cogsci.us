It was pretty straightforward.
It ran smoothly.
The shift key only increases the speed of movements initiated after you begin holding it down. That was odd.

The buttons made the same noise when walked over whether the player had walked over them previously or not.
The game didn't make it clear if you had already activated all the buttons - I did a cursory double-check around the map to make sure I did before choosing to leave.

The button hidden under the tree on the left side was a little too obvious, though.
