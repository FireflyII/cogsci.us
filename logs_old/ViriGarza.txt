The game was interesting, I initially though the white dots on the flor where spikes and I had to find another way but the instructions said nothing would harm the robot so I passed it. it was a bit challenging because a specific red dot had to be collected in order to unblock the path in order to reach the rest of the red dots. 
When the little robot hit something it would lag a little bit and if the shift key is not selected while playing the robot will move very slow. Overall it ran smoothly
I was not able to pass behind the tree trunk only the top part of the tree, the leaves.  
No, instructions where clear
