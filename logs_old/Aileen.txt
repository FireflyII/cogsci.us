This is a fun game not very hard to figure out or manage and something that stood out while I was playing was that the button were gateways to other passageways. 
The game did run smoothly and did not lag at all.
There was not any bugs or glitches that I noticed.
The instructions were clear and not confusing at all within the game.
I really liked how the game is retro it reminded me of playing games from when I was a kid.
